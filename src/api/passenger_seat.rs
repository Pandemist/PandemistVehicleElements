//! Passenger seat management functionality for transportation systems.
//!
//! This module provides structures and functions to manage passenger seats
//! in vehicles such as trains, buses, or other transportation systems.

/// Represents a passenger seat in a vehicle.
///
/// A `PassengerSeat` tracks the basic information about a seat, including
/// its identifier name and availability status. This structure is designed
/// to be extended with additional functionality for seat management.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use your_crate_name::PassengerSeat;
///
/// let seat = PassengerSeat::new("A1");
/// println!("Seat created: {:?}", seat);
/// ```
#[derive(Default, Debug)]

    ///
    /// The name parameter accepts any type that can be converted into a `String`,
    /// providing flexibility for different naming conventions.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `name` - The identifier for the seat (e.g., "A1", "12B", "Window-Left")
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```

    ///
    /// let seat1 = PassengerSeat::new("A1");
    /// let seat2 = PassengerSeat::new(String::from("B12"));

    /// This method controls whether a passenger can occupy this seat.
    /// When set to `false`, the seat becomes unavailable for booking or occupation.
    /// When set to `true`, the seat becomes available for passengers.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `state` - `true` to make the seat available, `false` to make it unavailable

    /// seat.set_valid(true);  // Make seat available
