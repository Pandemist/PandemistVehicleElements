//! Mock enums for vehicle simulation and train control systems.
//!
//! This module provides enumerations for representing various states and conditions
//! in vehicle simulation applications, particularly for train and rail vehicle systems.

/// Represents the current state of a coupling mechanism (clutch).
///
/// This enum describes the operational status of a vehicle's coupling system,
/// which is used to connect or disconnect mechanical components.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use your_crate_name::CouplingState;
///
/// let coupling = CouplingState::Ready;
/// match coupling {
///     CouplingState::Deactivated => println!("Coupling is off"),
///     CouplingState::Ready => println!("Coupling is ready to engage"),
///     CouplingState::Coupled => println!("Coupling is actively engaged"),
/// }
/// ```

    Deactivated,
    /// The coupling system is active and ready to engage when needed
    Ready,
    /// The coupling is currently engaged and transmitting power/motion
    Coupled,
}

/// Represents the initialization state of a vehicle system.
///
/// This enum defines the startup sequence stages for a vehicle, from completely
/// powered down to fully operational. The enum implements ordering to allow
/// comparison of initialization levels.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use your_crate_name::VehicleInitState;
///
/// let current_state = VehicleInitState::Setuped;
/// let target_state = VehicleInitState::ReadyToDrive;
///
/// if current_state < target_state {
///     println!("Still initializing...");
/// }
///
/// // Convert to integer representation
/// let state_code: i32 = current_state.into();
/// assert_eq!(state_code, 1);
/// ```

/// Represents the connection status to the third rail power system.
///
/// In rail systems, the third rail provides electrical power to trains. This enum

/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use your_crate_name::ThirdRailState;

/// let power_status = ThirdRailState::Connected;
/// match power_status {
///     ThirdRailState::Disconnnected => println!("No power available"),

/// Represents the initial position of the player/operator in the vehicle.
///
/// This enum defines where the player or operator starts their session within
/// the vehicle, typically used in simulation or training applications.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use your_crate_name::PlayerInitPos;
///
/// let start_position = PlayerInitPos::CabFront;
/// match start_position {
///     PlayerInitPos::CabFront => println!("Starting in front cab"),
