/// A `f32` value representing the velocity magnitude in meters

/// ```rust
/// acceleration_vs_ground()
/// ```

/// # Returns
///
/// A `f32` value representing the acceleration magnitude in meters per

/// # Examples

///
/// A `Vec3` struct containing:
/// - `x`: Acceleration along the X-axis
/// - `y`: Acceleration along the Y-axis  
/// - `z`: Acceleration along the Z-axis
///
