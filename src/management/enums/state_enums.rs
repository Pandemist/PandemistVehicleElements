/// Represents a state that tracks both current status and recent changes.
///
/// This enum is useful for tracking state transitions, particularly when you need

/// commonly used in event systems, UI updates, or state machines where transition
/// events are important.
///
/// # State Transitions
///
/// The enum captures four distinct states:
/// - `Off`: Currently off and was off previously
/// - `JustOff`: Currently off but was on previously (transition occurred)
/// - `JustOn`: Currently on but was off previously (transition occurred)  
/// - `On`: Currently on and was on previously
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use pandemist_vehicle_elements::ChangedState;
///
/// let state = ChangedState::default();
/// assert_eq!(state, ChangedState::On);
///
/// // Track state changes
/// let turning_on = ChangedState::to_changed(false, true);
/// assert_eq!(turning_on, ChangedState::JustOn);
